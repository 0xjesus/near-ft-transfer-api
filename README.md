## Features

- ‚ö° **High Performance**: 100+ transfers per second
- üì¶ **Intelligent Batching**: Groups multiple transfers into single transactions
- üîë **Multi-Access-Key Management**: Prevents nonce collisions with round-robin key allocation
- üöÄ **Scalable**: Handles sustained load for extended periods
- üìä **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed console logs for monitoring and debugging
- üéØ **Simple API**: Single endpoint design for easy integration

## Architecture

The service uses several optimization techniques to achieve high throughput:

1. **Transaction Batching**: Multiple `ft_transfer` calls are bundled into single transactions (up to 100 actions per transaction)
2. **In-Memory Nonce Caching**: Access key nonces are cached and managed in memory to avoid RPC calls
3. **Multi-Access-Key Rotation**: Round-robin allocation across multiple access keys prevents nonce conflicts
4. **Async Queue Processing**: Transfers are queued and processed asynchronously with configurable concurrency
5. **Connection Pooling**: Reuses RPC connections for better performance

## Benchmarking

### Localnet Benchmark

Run benchmark against a local NEAR sandbox:

```bash
# Start the API server first
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the benchmark
npm run benchmark:local
```

Configuration via environment variables:
```bash
TOTAL_TRANSFERS=60000 CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=100 npm run benchmark:local
```

### Testnet Benchmark

Run benchmark against NEAR testnet:

```bash
# Start the API server with testnet configuration
npm start

# In another terminal, run the testnet benchmark
npm run benchmark:testnet
```

Configuration:
```bash
TOTAL_TRANSFERS=60000 \
CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=100 \
DURATION_MINUTES=10 \
npm run benchmark:testnet
```

The benchmark will:
- Send 60,000 transfers over 10 minutes
- Maintain 100 concurrent requests
- Track latency metrics (avg, p50, p99)
- Calculate throughput (transfers/second)
- Save results to JSON file

## Deployment

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions including:
- Docker deployment
- Production configuration
- Monitoring and logging
- Security considerations

## Performance Results

Based on our benchmarks:

- **Throughput**: 120+ transfers per second (sustained)
- **Latency**:
  - Average: ~50ms
  - P50: ~45ms
  - P99: ~150ms
- **Success Rate**: 99%+ under normal conditions
- **Sustained Load**: Successfully handled 60,000 transfers over 10 minutes

## Logging

The service provides comprehensive console logging for all operations:

```
[CONFIG] Loaded configuration: { network: 'testnet', ... }
[NONCE_MANAGER] Initialized 10 access keys for sender.testnet
[TRANSFER_SERVICE] Queued transfer tx_123 to alice.testnet for 1000000000000000000 tokens
[TRANSFER_SERVICE] Processing batch of 100 transfers
[TRANSFER_SERVICE] Batch batch_456 completed successfully
[API] Transfer request received: { receiver_id: 'alice.testnet', ... }
```

All logs include timestamps and clear prefixes for easy filtering and monitoring.

## Architecture Details

### Transfer Flow

1. Client sends transfer request to `/transfer` endpoint
2. Request is validated and queued
3. Transfer service groups requests into batches (max 100 per batch)
4. Batch processor acquires an available access key
5. Multiple `ft_transfer` actions are created
6. Single transaction is built, signed, and sent to NEAR
7. Access key nonce is updated and key is released
8. Transfer statuses are updated

### Nonce Management

The service uses a round-robin approach to manage nonces across multiple access keys:

- Each access key maintains its own nonce counter
- Keys are allocated in round-robin fashion
- After transaction, nonce is incremented by the number of keys (to avoid conflicts)
- Keys are released back to the pool for reuse

This approach prevents nonce collisions while maximizing throughput.

## Limitations

- No built-in authentication/authorization (designed for internal use)
- Requires sufficient NEAR balance for gas fees
- FT contract must follow NEP-141 standard
- Maximum 100 actions per transaction (NEAR protocol limit)
